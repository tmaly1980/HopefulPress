Hi all,

I'm hoping to make some connections with rescue workers who would be willing to work together on a project. I've been working on a website system for the past several months for animal rescues because I noticed many rescues either have no website or an outdated/poorly designed website. I'm looking to work with 10 different rescues over the next month who can help provide preliminary feedback on my website service. It's a fairly ready-to-go website system based on a minimal monthly hosting fee, with all the important pages pre-made so all you have to do is fill-in-the-blanks. 

I'm hoping with this collaborative effort, we can come up with rescue websites that can get better word of mouth, more easily find homes for the adoptables, receive more online funding, and encourage people to apply for adoptions, fostering, and volunteering through easy web forms. I'd like to spend the next month evaluating and improving the website system so it can be a viable solution for typical volunteer-run and donor-funded rescues. Let me know what you think!
