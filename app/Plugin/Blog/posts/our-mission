The Hopeful Press Mission

=============================
The facts are grim. Somewhere between 6-8 million companion animals enter shelters each year. Approximately 1 in 3 are euthanized each year.
When an animal shelter is full (as they often are), they close their doors. Even "no-kill" shelters are allowed to euthanize 10% (or more) of 
their animals, especially due to behavioral or health issues.

Rescue organizations try to make up for that by having a relationship with local shelters such that they take in companion animals when possible, 
to help give them a second chance. Unlike shelters, most rescues are operated solely by volunteers who care for and provide foster homes for
these unwanted companions. Unlike shelters, expenses for food, care, medical costs, etc are usually acquired through private donations rather than
government funds. Most rescues involve a handful of involved families within the community and are extremely limited with the number of animals
they can take in and find homes for. It's through the work of animal rescue organizations that we can save the lives of the unwanted animal companions out there.

An animal rescue organization's success depends largely on it's ability to promote it's cause. In order to acquire the funds necessary to care for
adoptables and to find forever homes, it largely depends on the relationships and network of the group.

Having an online presence to an rescue group is essential to it's success. Through word of mouth and social media, friends can easily share information about rescue organizations.
The more people who can learn about your organization, the  more animals can be adopted. The more forever homes found, the faster that shelter animals can be taken into foster care.
In addition, the more people who learn about the rescue, the more volunteers and foster homes there can be. Rescues can receive more funding as well, when their network expands through online. Promoting the rescue's cause through digital channels is what saves more lives and gives more of these forgotten companion animals loving homes.

An essential aspect to online marketing of any non-profit organization is having a high quality website. Even with the success of social media, such as a Facebook page, a website provides distinct benefits:

- A website can provide organized content for easy browsing, allowing visitors to find the information they are most interested in. Each aspect of animal rescuing, fostering and adoption has it's own section.
- A website provides an up-to-date glance at the whole organization
- A website can offer educational articles relating to the adoption process, spaying/neutering, and tips on pet ownership/care
- A website can list resources to further information and related organizations, such as clinics, training schools, welfare organizations, etc
- Visitors can easily browse a database of available adoptables
- A website can provide a place for online donations, sponsorships and joining a mailing list. 
- A website can provide online forms for requesting involvement, through adoptions, volunteering, and fostering
- Potential donors can easily see the success of the rescue through adoption stories, recent news, upcoming events, photos, and more.
- A website is available to share with anyone, especially outside of social media systems like Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Having a dedicated website to promote your rescue organization is an essential part to it's success. However, not all websites are guaranteed for success.
Some of the biggest challenges with an all-volunteer organization getting ideal exposure online includes lack of funds to pay a professional web designer,
being limited to a poor quality website, or not having the ability to update the website frequently enough.

Having a high quality website can make a huge difference. Some of the key aspects in a high quality website include:
- Having a professional-looking design that can make a better impression on potential donors and adopters.
- Having a way to easily update content, including removing adopted animals, and adding recently available adoptables.
- Being able to make these changes yourself, without having to rely upon the schedule/availability (or fees) of a professional web designer.
- Frequent updates establish longer-lasting relationships. If a website hasn't been updated in 6+ months, potential donors/adopters will less likely get involved. 
- Website updates through news, events, photos and adoption stories encourage people to care, share with others, or get involved themselves.
- Easy to share through word of mouth, via email newsletters/notices, social media sharing buttons, etc. Share buttons on adoptable listings encourage friends to tell friends.
- A mailing list establishes a contact list for urgent needs (such as medical expenses, transport needs, etc) as well as keep people aware of your accomplishments and preserving long-term relationships.
- Posting upcoming events lets people know how and when they can meet you and get involved
- Having a mobile-device friendly website makes it significantly easier for people to share, visit or get involved with your organization, by allowing them to visit your website at their convenience, during a conversation with a friend, while at a coffee shop, adoption event, etc. Nearly 2/3rds of American adults own a smartphone, more than desktop or laptop computers. 80% of internet users do so using a smartphone, and nearly 70% of those searches lead to some sort of action within an hour. It simply provides a convenience that cannot be overlooked. Without a mobile-friendly design, visitors will merely see a web page with micoscopic text and impossible navigation, easily discouraging involvement.

OUR MISSION

When we first started speaking to animal rescues, we noticed an underserved community. Since rescues are a small-scale, purely volunteer-run and private donation-funded organization, getting a quality website that serves all their needs becomes difficult. Professional designers charge more than they can afford or work pro-bono and have limited availability when help is needed. Many rescue websites are horribly outdated, raising question to their current activity. Are they worth donating to? Do they have any available adoptables when all I see are listings from 6 months ago?

Let's not put any obstacles in front of potential donors, volunteers and adopters - let's make it easy for them to get involved and save these animals' lives. Hopeful Press is a dedicated web development company whose sole goal is to provide quality websites for typical grassroots animal rescue groups within their financial means. We take a collaborative approach where we receive input from many rescues and create a common solution to their shared problems. In the process, we can do good by saving the lives of forgotten companion animals.
