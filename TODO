==========================
be willing to be awful
-
DONT NEED TO IMPLEMENT FINE DETAILED FEATURES -
we are appealing to EARLY ADOPTERS
just trying to prove the basic concept of needs, features, benefits, etc.
- only MASS USERS need fine details to figure out stuff
- just go and see how much can be implicit/intuited
- when im trying to double my customers/money, THEN i can spend time on minor details


WHAT MATTERS IS THEM GETTING THEIR JOB DONE - does it?
